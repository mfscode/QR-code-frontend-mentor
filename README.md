## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 basic elements
- CSS

### What I learned

I just learned how to make a smooth shadow, the trick is to use a moderate blur and lowerning down the opacity of the shadow


```css
.container {
  box-shadow: 5px 5px 50px rgb(0, 0, 0, .6);
}
```

### Continued development

Gotta dig down the flexbox and shadow hole, not really feeling like using shadow or flexbox builder since it's not really learning and i want to master the basic first

### Useful resources

- [Neumorphism.io](https://neumorphism.io/#e0e0e0) - Didn't use this in this project, but I sometimes open it to see beautiful shadows
